# Room impulse response extraction software with swept-sine technique (with GUI)

In an Signal & Systems course, a software was developed in MatLab that allows to extract the impulse response of a room, taking as reference the swept-sine technique developed by Angelo Farina. To use the software, a GUI was developed. In this project, parameters such as the EDT, T10, T20 and T30 are calculated to characterize the enclosure. Also the process of calculate the room parameters can be done by the mean of several impulse responses.
